# Notes/Reflection

I liked the workflow and folder structure of having components inside the same folder with their respective sass stylesheets. One adjustment I would make in the future is to get all of the structure and content into a page before doing any significant styling. There were several things I styled at the component level that would have made more sense and been DRYer if I styled them on the global level, and this would be easier to predict if I had got all of the content in before styling.

Another takeaway from this project is that during the early stages it makes more sense to focus less on making everything perfect and more on getting a baseline finished product. At the start of the project, I was making one section of the page at a time and fully building that section out and styling it. Towards the end of the project I got a baseline section finished first and went back at the end and did things like adding media queries for responsiveness and adjusting typography. For me this workflow was much faster since I was batching alike tasks.
